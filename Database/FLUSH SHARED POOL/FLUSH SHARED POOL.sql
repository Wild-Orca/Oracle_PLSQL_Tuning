The ALTER SYSTEM FLUSH SHARED_POOL statement is used in Oracle Database to flush the shared pool, which is part of the SGA (System Global Area). The shared pool contains various structures, such as SQL and PL/SQL code, data dictionary cache, and other shared information.

Executing this statement has the effect of removing all SQL and PL/SQL code from the shared pool, forcing the database to re-parse and re-execute SQL statements when they are next encountered. This can be useful in certain scenarios, such as when you want to clear the shared pool to address performance issues or test the impact of a particular query on the system.

Here is an example of how you might use it:

    ALTER SYSTEM FLUSH SHARED_POOL;

Please note that flushing the shared pool can be a drastic action and may have performance implications, especially in a production environment. It should be done with caution and ideally during a maintenance window or low-activity period.

Additionally, flushing the shared pool might not be necessary for routine database maintenance. In a well-tuned system, the Oracle database should manage the shared pool efficiently. If you are facing specific issues, it is recommended to analyze and address the root cause rather than relying on frequent manual flushing.
